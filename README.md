# AssignmentOrganizer

Organizes assignments based on priorities and allows user to sub-modulize and link their assignments with other assignments they may have.
Users may build groups and for each group, users may be given lead roles to administrate tasks.
Files and links may be uploaded to allow user groups to share ideas, pictures, and other media.
Each task has its own sub-tasks and notes organized by priority so that users can make notes along the process.
